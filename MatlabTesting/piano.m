% Final Project: Piano Sound Synthesis
% By: Teng Wei Jian

%
% NOTES:
% 1) This is a function that synthesizes the sound of a piano. It takes the
% frequency of the note to be modeled as an input and returns the signal
% of the synthesized note as an output. The function will also play the
% sound once.
% 2) The code is divided into two parts, the first part will model the
% force signal of the piano hammer and the second part will model the
% piano string. Extra notes regarding each part will be included at the
% beginning of each section.

% PART I: PIANO HAMMER MODEL
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 1) As detailed in the report, the model is defaulted to simulate the
% force of the hammer strike for a C4 string with the initial velocity
% of 4 m/s.
% 2) The parameters of the hammer can be changed according to the measured
% values (if available). Otherwise the same force signal will be used to
% simulate ALL the notes.
